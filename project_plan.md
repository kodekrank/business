##What We Are:
KodeKrank is a game development company that builds web-based games for teaching programmatic thinking to children in the elementary and middle-school age.

##Why We Are Important:
As technology progresses to become an irreversibly intricate part of society, programmatic thinking is becoming more of a necessary skill. Learning these skills occurs more easily at younger stages of life.

##Our Market:
We are marketing ourselves to children age 6-11. Our target customers will also be the parents of said children, which is a market size of 26 million children.

##Competitors:
Scratch and Alice are visual based programming languages
Hacket-hack and Arduino are IDE built for children
Mindstorms are building robots

- Cargobot is an ipad game to teach programming concepts using blocks. 

##Why We are Different: 
Unlike previous teaching tools for children we are focused on teaching programming concepts, not just programming. We feel that children are better equipped to enter the tech field if they know the "why" not just the "how". We also will make it simple and easy to use so that it is non-intimidating for children to get started. 

##How We Make Money:
1. Website (gain traction)
2. Create mobile / tablet apps
3. Long-run: selling to schools / educational institutions / tutoring programs

##Ideas:
